// MODULE SYSTEM

// in React project we are going to create a different file for each component
// we also declare variales in different files and then share them between files

// WITHOUT USING THE MODULE SYSTEM we cannot share variables between files

// There is a import/export system in JS with many rules

// there are two types of export files:
// 1) default export
// 2) named export

// One file can only have one default export
